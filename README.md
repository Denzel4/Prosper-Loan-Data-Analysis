## Summary of Findings

> The relationship between the variables is intertwined. The State of the borrower influnces his\her loan qualification.Not only that but also their career,occupation and employment status.
> The income distribution is so disperse,state wise,a desire for higher income means one should move to particular states such as Carlifonia.
> The loan repayment is a major factor to be considered by all parties involved. There are risky states and safe states for investors.These investor safe states could be risky for borrowers.
>The data could have also been enriched by the population data,gender, as the skewness brought by some states could be as a result of them being heavily populated. The gender would also help in finding out if borrowers are likely to be women or men.
